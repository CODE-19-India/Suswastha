### COVID-19 Hotspot & Service Mapper

We, the students of **Kalyani Government Engineering College** present before you our project - **Suswastha**, the all in one Corona Safety Assistance for one and all! 

**Suswastha** is a web application that serves not only the civilians with assistance regarding to Corona but also to the police and other responsible authorities. Focussed on controlling community transfer, our project offers Live Map Tracking, an unfettered chat bot - **Swastha Sahayak**, availing its users to stay informed about nearby COVID-19 hotspots as well as to be able to inform the authorities regarding new cases in their locality that are unnoticed and require attention; availing the authorities to get information about these complaints by users and their exact location and much more!

The users of this application have the option to submit the problems they are facing like shortage of food, water sanitising equipments etcetera that requires the help from the government or of any higher authority. 

Thus the main motive of this project is not only to help people stay more alert by having a very clear visual status of the areas they are in and interacting with the AI bot but also to benefit the authorities responsible for tackling and tracing new **COVID-19** cases as the live visualization offered is something we have been missing on. 
Stay safe, stay home!
